# Image Classification using Deep Learning
• Conducted data cleaning using Numpy and Pandas libraries, and performed feature extraction using Scikit-learn.
• Trained a classification model across 20+ categories with EfficientNetB0 and VGG16 Convolutional Neural Networks in Keras.
• Implemented transfer learning and fine-tuning to establish an increasing learning rate on training and validation data.
